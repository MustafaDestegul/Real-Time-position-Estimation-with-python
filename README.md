# Real-Time-position-Estimation-with-python
Real-time 2D position estimation of the robot on python with a fixed camera outside of the game field.

  By using motion detection and edge detection algorithms, I implement a python code for our robot project to be used to estimate the 2D position real-time with maximum performance. At the beginning, to reach my goal, I used the color detection and edge detection algorithms but the error was very high, the I decided motion detection instead of color detection.
